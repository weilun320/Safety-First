<p> A drug is any substance (other than food that provides nutritional support) that, when inhaled, injected, smoked, consumed, 
absorbed via a patch on the skin, or dissolved under the tongue causes a temporary physiological (and often psychological) change in the body. <br><br>
In pharmacology, a drug is a chemical substance of known structure, other than a nutrient of an essential dietary ingredient, which, 
when administered to a living organism, produces a biological effect. A pharmaceutical drug, also called a medication or medicine, is a 
chemical substance used to treat, cure, prevent, or diagnose a disease or to promote well-being. Traditionally drugs were obtained through extraction 
from medicinal plants, but more recently also by organic synthesis. Pharmaceutical drugs may be used for a limited duration, or on a regular basis for 
chronic disorders.<br><br>The cause of drugs abuse is getting severe in the recent years, it is much worried by the government and so there are 
numerous governmental offices in many countries that deal with the control and oversee of drug manufacture and use, and the implementation of 
various drug laws. The Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs is an international treaty brought about in 1961 to prohibit the use of narcotics save 
for those used in medical research and treatment. In 1971, a second treaty the Convention on Psychotropic Substances had to be introduced to deal 
with newer recreational psychoactive and psychedelic drugs.<br><br>
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States is a federal agency responsible for protecting and promoting public health through the 
regulation and supervision of food safety, tobacco products, dietary supplements, prescription and over-the counter medications, vaccines, 
biopharmaceuticals, blood transfusions, medical devices, electromagnetic radiation emitting devices, cosmetics, animal foods and veterinary drugs.
