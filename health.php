<p><b>Health care</b> is the maintenance or improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease, 
illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in human beings. Healthcare is delivered by health professionals (providers or practitioners) 
in allied health fields. Physicians and physician associates are a part of these health professionals. Dentistry, midwifery, nursing, medicine, 
optometry, audiology, pharmacy, psychology, occupational therapy, physical therapy and other health professions are all part of healthcare. It includes 
work done in providing primary care, secondary care, and tertiary care, as well as in public health.<br><br>
Access to health care may vary across countries, communities, and individuals, largely influenced by social and economic conditions as well as the health 
policies in place. Countries and jurisdictions have different policies and plans in relation to the personal and population-based health care goals within 
their societies.<br><br> Healthcare systems are organizations established to meet the health needs of targeted populations. Their exact configuration 
varies between national and subnational entities. In some countries and jurisdictions, health care planning is distributed among market participants, 
whereas in others, planning occurs more centrally among governments or other coordinating bodies. In all cases, according to the World Health Organization 
(WHO), a well-functioning healthcare system requires a robust financing mechanism; a well-trained and adequately paid workforce; reliable information on 
which to base decisions and policies; and well maintained health facilities and logistics to deliver quality medicines and technologies.

				<p>To improve your fitness quickly and lose weight, harness the joys of interval training.<br>
				Set the treadmill or step machine on the interval programme, where your speed and workload varies from minute to minute.<br><br>
				Build up gradually, every minute and return to the starting speed. 
				Repeat this routine. Not only will it be less monotonous, but you can train for a shorter time and achieve greater results.<br><br></p>

				<h3 class="w3-text-blue-grey">Diet</h3>
				<p>Eating a balanced diet is vital for good health and wellbeing.<br>
				Food provides our bodies with the energy, protein, essential fats, vitamins and minerals to live,<br><br>
				grow and function properly. We need a wide variety of different foods to provide the right amounts of nutrients for good health.<br><br></p>
			
		
			<div class="w3-quarter">
				<h3 class="w3-text-blue-grey">Bone up daily</h3>
				<p>Get your daily calcium by popping a tab, chugging milk or eating yoghurt. It’ll keep your bones strong.<br>
				Remember that your bone density declines after the age of 30. You need at least 200 milligrams daily,<br>
				which you should combine with magnesium, or it simply won’t be absorbed.<br><br></p>

				<h3 class="w3-text-blue-grey">Load up on vitamin C</h3>

				fruit and vegetables every day. So hit the oranges and guavas!<br><br></p>

				<h3 class="w3-text-blue-grey">Berries for your belly</h3>
				<p>Blueberries, strawberries and raspberries contain plant nutrients known as anthocyanidins,

				the antioxidant compound found in red wine that has assumed near mythological proportions. 
				Resveratrol is believed to help protect against heart disease and cancer.<br><br></p>

				<h3 class="w3-text-blue-grey">I say tomato</h3>
				<p>Tomato is a superstar in the fruit and veggie pantheon. Tomatoes contain lycopene, a powerful cancer fighter. 
				They’re also rich in vitamin C. The good news is that cooked tomatoes are also nutritious, so use them in pasta, 
				soups and casseroles, as well as in salads.<br><br></p>
