    <h3 class="w3-text-blue-grey" style="text-align: center; font-size: 100px"><b>What is safer sex <br>(safe sex)?</b></h3>

<p><b>Safe sex</b> is having sexual contact while protecting yourself and your sexual partner against sexually transmissible infections (STIs) and 
unplanned pregnancy. Sexual contact that doesn’t involve the exchange of semen, vaginal fluids or blood between partners is considered to be 
safe sex.Unsafe sex may put you or your partner at risk of STIs such as chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis, Mycoplasma genitalium, HIV or 
hepatitis B, or may result in an unplanned pregnancy.<br><br>Condoms offer the best available protection against STIs by acting as a physical 
barrier to prevent the exchange of semen, vaginal fluids or blood between partners. Safe sex is also called ‘safer sex’ to highlight the fact 
that condoms and other barrier methods are not 100 per cent effective in preventing STIs. However, condoms do offer the best available 
protection when used correctly.<br><br>Safer sex is also about having sex when you and your partner are ready, and having sex that’s enjoyable, 
respectful and protected. Ways that you can practice safer sex include having sex with only one partner, when neither of you has any STIs, 
is the safest way to have sex. Be STI free by getting tested for common infections and having treatment if necessary, especially if you have 
a new partner. Avoid sexual contact until the doctor or nurse tells you that you are no longer infectious and until both you and you partner 
have been treated.<br><br>Next, we must be aware that drugs and alcohol may affect your ability to make good decisions. Protect yourself from 
having sex that you might regret or were pressured into because you weren’t thinking properly. Also, consider the use other types of contraception 
in addition to a condom to avoid unplanned pregnancy. </p>

				<h3 class="w3-text-blue-grey">How does safer sex help protect me from STDs?</h3>
				<p>STDs are infections that are passed from one person to another during sexual activity. <br>
				Anybody who has oral, anal, or vaginal sex, or genital skin-to-skin contact with another person can get STDs.<br>
				Safer sex (often called “safe sex”) means taking steps to protect yourself and your partner from STDs when you have sex.<br><br></p>

				<h3 class="w3-text-blue-grey">Making sex safer</h3>
				<p>One of the best ways is by using a barrier — like condoms, female condoms, and/or dental dams <br>
				every single time you have oral, anal, or vaginal sex. <br><br>
				Barriers cover parts of your genitals, protecting you and your partner from body fluids 
				and some skin-to-skin contact, which can both spread STDs.  <br><br></p>

				<h3 class="w3-text-blue-grey">Types of stds</h3>
				<p>They are also known as sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or venereal diseases (VD).<br><br><br></p>
			
		
			<div class="w3-quarter">
				<h3 class="w3-text-blue-grey">Chlamydia</h3>
				<p>Chlamydia is an STD caused by Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis). 
				This bacterium only infects humans. Chlamydia is the most common infectious cause of genital and eye diseases globally. 
				It is also the most common bacterial STD.<br><br>
				Women with chlamydia do not usually show symptoms. Any symptoms are usually non-specific and may include:
				<ul style="text-align: left">
					<li> bladder infection </li>
					<li> a change in vaginal discharge</li>
					<li> mild lower abdominal pain </li>
					<li> pelvic pain </li>
				</ul>
				</p>

			<div class="w3-quarter">
				<h3 class="w3-text-blue-grey">Chancroid</h3>
				<p>Chancroid is also known as soft chancre and ulcus molle. It is a bacterial infection caused by called streptobacillus Haemophilus ducreyi.<br>
				The infection causes painful sores on the genitals and is only spread through sexual contact.<br>
				While these tips are great for improvements, they certainly do not cover every area of school safety. <br>
				This infection is more common in developing nations, especially among commercial sex workers and some lower socioeconomic groups. <br>
				This is due to the lack of access to healthcare services, <br>
				the stigma attached to seeking help, a lack of sufficient sexual health education, and other factors.<br><br></p>

				<h3 class="w3-text-blue-grey">Genital herpes</h3>
				<p>This STD is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). The virus affects the skin, cervix, genitals, and some other parts of the body. There are two types:<br>
				<ul style="text-align: left">
					<li> HSV-1, known as herpes type 1 </li>
					<li> HSV-2, known as herpes type 2</li>
				</ul>
				Herpes is a chronic condition. A significant number of individuals with herpes never show symptoms and do not know about their herpes status. <br>
				HSV is easily transmissible from human to human through direct contact. Most commonly, transmission of type 2 HSV occurs through 
				vaginal, oral, or anal sex. Type 1 is more commonly transmitted from shared straws, utensils, and surfaces.<br><br></p>
