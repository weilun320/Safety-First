<p>Did you know that playing tennis with a badly strung racquet while wearing worn-out shoes can increase your risk of injury almost as much 
as playing football without shoulder pads? Using the wrong or not properly fitted with the suitable equipment is a major cause of injuries. 
The equipment you wear while participating in sports and other activities is key to preventing injuries. Helmets are important for sports such 
as football, hockey, baseball, softball, biking, skateboarding, inline skating, skiing, and snowboarding. The eye protection is also a must for 
many sports such as  soccer, basketball, racquet sports, snowboarding, street hockey, and baseball and softball when fielding. The most 
protective eye gear is made from a plastic called polycarbonate and has been tested especially for sports use. Wrist, knee, and elbow guards 
are important gear too, they prevent arm and wrist fractures, and knee guards can shield your knees from cuts and breaks.<br><br>
Don't rush into any sport or exercise without warming up first because if our muscles haven't been properly prepared tend to be injured easily. 
Start out with some light cardiovascular activities, such as easy jogging, jumping jacks, or brisk walking, just to get your muscles going. 
Follow your brief warm-up with some stretches. (Stretching works best after a warm-up because your tissues are more elastic [flexible] due 
to the increase in heat and blood flow to the muscles.)<br><br>In addition to warm-ups and stretches, practice sessions are also excellent 
preparation for most sports or activities. If you belong to a team, attend as many team practices and games as possible. This will put you in 
top physical condition and help you and your teammates work together, knowing how your teammates play will help prevent injuries.

				<p>Always wear a helmet made for the sport you're playing.<br><br>
				 When choosing a bike helmet, look for a sticker that says the helmet meets the safety standard set by the <br>
				 Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), a federal regulatory agency that creates safety standards for <br>
				 bike helmets and other safety equipment. <br><br></p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="w3-quarter">
				<p> If you use a multi-sport helmet for inline skating and skateboarding, it is not considered safe for bicycle <br>
				riding unless it has the CPSC sticker. <br><br>
				Any helmet should fit snugly but comfortably on your head and shouldn't tilt backward or forward.<br><br><br></p>

				<p> If you wear glasses, you'll probably need prescription polycarbonate goggles — don't just wear your regular <br>
				glasses when you're on the court or field. <br><br>
				All eye protection should fit securely and have cushions above your eyebrows and over your nose. <br><br></p>
