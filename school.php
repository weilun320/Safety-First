<p>Protecting our children is not simply a matter of public policy. It is a matter of strengthening basic values, of teaching children 
right from wrong, of instilling in them respect for others. We each have a responsibility to work to end youth violence and to keep schools 
safe for children and for those who teach them. Youth violence in many schools has reached universal proportions. It is not only happening 
in our high schools, it has also made its way into our elementary and middle schools. Everyone seems to have a different perspective on why 
there is such a problem with school safety. Some say it is the parents' fault, some say it is the media, and others blame the schools. Yet, 
the question remains. What can be done to make schools safer for the children and staff? <br><br>
One thing we need to do is learn to listen to our children and observe their behavior. According to Dr. Ronald D. Stephens, Executive Director 
of the National School Safety Center, there are some common characteristics among youth who have caused school- associated violent deaths. 
Accounts of these tragic incidents repeatedly indicate that in most cases, a troubled youth has demonstrated or has talked about problems with 
bullying and feelings of isolation, anger, depression, and frustration. <br><br>
Safe schools promote the protection of students from violence, exposure to weapons and threats, theft, bullying, and the sale or use of illegal 
substances on school grounds.  School safety is linked to improved student and school outcomes. In particular, emotional and physical safety in 
school are related to academic performance. At the same time, students who are victims of physical or emotional harassment or who are involved 
in the sale or use of illegal substances on school grounds are at risk for poor attendance, course failure and dropout.

				<h3 class="w3-text-blue-grey">Set Clear Rules & Limits for Students on Violence</h3>
				<p>Ensure your students know from day one what constitutes unacceptable behavior in regards to violence.<br>
				 Outline that pushing, shoving and even threats count as violence and will be dealt with according to your school’s rules.<br><br></p>

				<h3 class="w3-text-blue-grey">Bully-Proof Your Classroom</h3>
				<p>In recent years, focus has shifted from physical violence to verbal violence and bullying.<br>
				 Bullying is a crisis affecting schools throughout the U.S. and it is important as educators to say “no” to bullying from day one. <br><br>
				Take a proactive approach against bullying by engaging students in team-building activities, 
				responding instantly to hurtful behavior and involving principals and parents when appropriate.<br><br></p>

				<h3 class="w3-text-blue-grey">Keep Your Classroom Organized</h3>
				<p>Another way to improve school safety is to keep your classroom, hallways and other school areas organized and free of hazards. <br>
				Check that classroom tools and objects are easily accessible for students and not on top of high cabinets or shelves.<br><br>
				That way, you eliminate any chance of a student falling while trying to reach an object.<br><br></p>

				<h3 class="w3-text-blue-grey">Raise Fire Safety Awareness</h3>
				<p>While fire drills can seem repetitive at times, practicing them seriously <br>
				can be the difference between safety and danger in the event of a fire emergency.<br>
				Besides running fire drills in accordance with your state’s requirements,<br>
				include fire safety awareness refreshers every month or so in the classroom<br><br>
				Go over the escape route(s), extinguisher locations and fire safety tips like staying low when there is smoke.<br><br></p>

				<h3 class="w3-text-blue-grey">Maintain Locks on Doors and Windows</h3>
				<p>In the unfortunate event of a school emergency requiring a lock down, properly working locks are of the utmost importance.<br>
				Regularly check classroom locks and report any faulty equipment to school maintenance crews for immediate repair.<br>
				While these tips are great for improvements, they certainly do not cover every area of school safety. <br>
				Therefore, if you have any other school safety tips to share with fellow educators,<br>
