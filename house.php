<p><b>Home safety</b> refers to the awareness and education of risks and potential dangers in and around a home which may cause bodily harm, 
injury, or even death to those residing in and around the physical structure of a home. It includes mitigating or preventing the unwanted 
dangers through testing, research and accepted standards of applications and practices.<br><br>
The most common practice of house safety is to do a home safety plans to prepare for any accident happened such as when house is lit on fire, 
safety features like the fire extinguishers, fire alarms, smoke alarms and heat detectors are needed. Family safety plans are an essential tool 
in fire safety because the plan helps family members to identify a fire escape plan. A safety plan includes knowing two ways out of every room, a 
safe place for members to meet outside of a burning home, and essential emergency telephone numbers. It is important to practice fire escape plans. 
Also, it is a must to have a first aid kit in every house. <br><br> Fire alarms monitors the environmental changes associated with combustion. Once the 
alarm has been triggered by fire or smoke, a loud sound emanates to warn of danger and sends a message to a central monitoring center, which then 
notifies the local fire department. Smoke alarms also known as smoke detectors, generally sound an audible and visual alarm. Smoke alarms are usually 
housed in a disk-shaped plastic enclosure about 6 inches in diameter and 1 inch thick and are often powered by a disposable battery. Heat detectors 
are a device that responds to changes in ambient temperature. Heat detectors are not meant to replace smoke detectors. They are often placed in rooms 
where standard smoke detectors are not suitable, such as laundry rooms, garages, and attics.
